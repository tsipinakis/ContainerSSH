# ContainerSSH logger

This package provides a Logger interface that can log all kinds of messages and errors, including the Message
interface from the message package. It provides the following methods for logging:

```go
logger.Debug(message ...interface{})
logger.Info(message ...interface{})
logger.Notice(message ...interface{})
logger.Warning(message ...interface{})
logger.Error(message ...interface{})
logger.Critical(message ...interface{})
logger.Alert(message ...interface{})
logger.Emergency(message ...interface{})
```

You are encouraged to pass a message.Message implementation to it.
We also provide the following compatibility methods which log at the info level.

```go
logger.Log(v ...interface{})
logger.Logf(format string, v ...interface{})
```

We provide a method to create a child logger that has a different minimum log level. Messages below this level will
be discarded:

```go
newLogger := logger.WithLevel(log.LevelInfo)
```

We can also create a new logger copy with default labels added:

```go
newLogger := logger.WithLabel("label name", "label value")
```

Finally, the logger also supports calling the Rotate() and Close() methods. Rotate() instructs the output to
close all handles and reopen them to facilitate rotating logs. Close() permanently closes the writer.

## Creating a logger

The Logger interface is intended for generic implementations. The default implementation can be created as follows:

```go
logger, err := log.NewLogger(config)
```

Alternatively, you can also use the log.MustNewLogger method to skip having to deal with the error. (It will
panic if an error happens.)

If you need a factory you can use the log.LoggerFactory interface and the log.NewLoggerFactory to create a factory
you can pass around. The Make(config) method will make a new logger when needed.
